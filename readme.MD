# PandaCorp

Save the panda! PandaCorp is a WordPress theme that you need to build in order to save the pandas.

It doesnâ€™t have to be pixel perfect, but the result has to look good so use your own judgement to make the necessary decisions and prioritize your work. Make the most important features first.
Make the layout work on phones and tablets (we always work under the mobile first principal).

Inside the theme you will find a pandacorp.zip file which contains the assets you need.


### Design details:
* Font family; Roboto
* Black: #000
* Alt black: #363942
* Grey: #EFF0F4
* State: #3558D7


### What we are looking for
* Editable content
* Use of wp_nav_menu()
* Option to upload custom logo.
* No use of 3. party themes or pagebuilder plugins
* Well documented code


Good luck and have fun making our awesome Panda website! 

***THEY'RE SO FLUFFY I'M GONNA DIE!***
